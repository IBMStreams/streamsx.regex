streamsx.regex
==============
This toolkit provides support for 2 libraries:
- [Boost Xpressive](https://theboostcpplibraries.com/boost.xpressive) regular expression library.
- [RE2](https://code.google.com/p/re2) regular expression library.

RE2 uses automata theory to guarantee that regular expression searches run in time linear in the size of the input. Web page with SPLDoc for operators and samples: [streamsx.regex SPLDoc](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.regex).
