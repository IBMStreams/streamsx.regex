Support for [http://code.google.com/p/re2|RE2] regular expression library.

RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python.
RE2 uses [http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html|automata theory] to guarantee that regular expressions run in time linear in the size of the input.

This toolkit provides several operators and native finctions to run RE2 engine in compilation or interpretation mode.
* Compilation mode: The regex is compiled  and executed on the first call, then directly executed on the subsequent calls.
* Interpretation mode: The regex is interpreted on each call.

Each operator/native function implements partial or full regex match.

**Third-party libraries**
* This toolkit embeds RE2 headers/libraries under impl/&lt;include|lib>.
